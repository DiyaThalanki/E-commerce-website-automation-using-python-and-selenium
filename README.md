## E-Commerce Automation Project

### Overview

This project is a comprehensive automation solution for navigating an e-commerce website, selecting items, modifying quantities, and completing the checkout process using Selenium WebDriver in Python. The automation script simulates a user journey, making it suitable for functional testing, automated quality assurance, or as a demonstration of proficiency in browser automation.

### Features

- **Navigation and Item Search:**
  - Automatically navigates through the e-commerce site to find specified products.
  - Uses various locators and strategies to identify and interact with elements on the webpage.

- **Cart Management:**
  - Adds selected items to the shopping cart.
  - Adjusts item quantities as needed before proceeding to checkout.

- **Screenshot Capture:**
  - Captures screenshots at specific stages of the automation process for logging or verification purposes.

- **Date Selection:**
  - Automates the process of selecting delivery dates or other date-related inputs within forms.

- **Complete Checkout Process:**
  - Fills out the necessary forms for guest checkout, including entering user information and selecting payment options.
  - Submits the order, simulating a complete transaction.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Automation Tool:** Selenium WebDriver
- **Web Browser:** Google Chrome (with ChromeDriver)


### Usage

- **Modify Script:** Before running the script, ensure that the product details, URLs, and form input data are correctly specified in the script to match the target e-commerce site.
- **Logs and Screenshots:** The script generates logs and saves screenshots at key points in the process to the designated folder for review.

### Learnings and Takeaways

- **Automated Testing:** Gained experience in creating robust, automated test cases for web applications, covering a wide range of scenarios.
- **Web Scraping and Interaction:** Enhanced skills in web scraping and interaction using XPath, CSS Selectors, and Selenium's WebDriver.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage dynamic content and unexpected webpage behaviors.

### Future Improvements

- **Support for Multiple Browsers:** Extend support to other browsers like Firefox and Safari.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Add more detailed reporting features, including test case results and screenshots in a structured format.
- **Scalability:** Implement data-driven testing to automate checkout processes for multiple products and variations.
